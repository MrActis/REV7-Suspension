# REV7 Suspension
## Directory
**Modules**
- [Dynamics](dynamics.py): classes and functions used to model suspension dynamics
- [Components](components.py): classes for defining suspension components
- [Functions](functions.py): functions for static suspension calculations

**Models**
- [Rear Suspension](rearsuspension.py): full quarter model of right rear suspension without tire

**Files**
- [Graphs](Graphs): contains graphs that plot angles and forces during suspension movement
    - [Angles](Graphs/Graphs%20-%20Angles): graphs that plot relative motion of suspension components
    - [Forces](Graphs/Graphs%20-%20Forces): graphs that plot forces on rocker
